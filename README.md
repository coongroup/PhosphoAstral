# Fast and Deep Phosphoproteome Analysis with the Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer

## Abstract
Owing to its roles in cellular signal transduction, protein phosphorylation plays critical roles in myriad cell processes. That said, it detecting and quantifying protein phosphorylation has remainded a challenge. We describe use of a novel mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Astral) coupled with data-independent acquisition (DIA) to achieve rapid and deep analysis of human and mouse phosphoproteomes. With this method we map approximately  30,000 unique human phosphorylation sites within a half-hour of data collection. We applied this approach to generate a phosphoproteome multi-tissue atlas of the mouse. Altogether, we detected 81,120 unique phosphorylation sites within 12 hours of measurement. With this unique dataset, we examine the sequence and structural context of protein phosphorylation. Finally, we highlight the discovery potential of this resource with multiple examples of novel phosphorylation events relevant to mitochondrial and brain biology.
